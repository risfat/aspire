# Aspire

This web application will solve the issue of staying focused on our goals and tasks. It
will also solve the problem with the organizations of essential documents and
knowledgebase. Without a proper system, it can be very messy across multiple tools,
folders, repositories, emails, and uncategorized Google Docs. Therefore, a system like
Aspire can be beneficial to stay focused and be up to date & be more productive.
